## Before all of all

### For some reason, we have not yet developed our project, but by following these records of our development as a diary, you might be able to know what we do.

### Steps:

- [ ] ***set up a project named Oroph, which is a social website based on a Recknerd server.***

### Details:

- Oroph is a social website where anybody should have a voice and freedom of speech on it (as long as they follow the regulations).

- Oroph is going to be built with Django and else tools. 

- Once the website is built, it will first be promoted to be used in form of an invitation (which lasts for 7 days), as we need to test how many people are predicted to use this website by inviting.

#### A notable one is its profit model, which is expanded as follows -

### Special:

#### Especially, we are going to discuss its profit model here. So what is its profit model? - Promotional Accounts (You must be wondering why we have to make a profit; well, we have to because the community must be opening enough [Unlike Some Communities], and if we want to run it forever, there must be some money that we can run the community with; it is the support of the whole big community. But we are going to make the ADs exist like nothing, as we talked about in the following content).

#### As we researched, earns of Twitter were mainly from their advertisement promotions. This means as we are building this website, there must be a distinction between those of accounts registered - **ACCOUNTS** & **PROMOTIONAL ACCOUNTS**. But, what will happen after this is solved?

#### Well, if the account is a promotional account, users will be able to publish advertising/promotional content related to their products, goods, etc. One of the greatest AD strategies taken by Twitter is to show a single user the AD for only a single time which means their users will not get bored by the AD but take a try with those promoted goods or products, then, Twitter will get earns - IT'S WHERE TWITTER SMART AT! We must copy that kind of mind into our products to make sure there will not be strategies not suited to users as we are surfing the Internet. After this, we should also build our strategy - make the ADs exist like nothing! We will need to make people a clear environment, whether from its content or its UI. So ***<u>we must "hide" the ADs and make them "not appear" (Which means we must show them the content but it needs to be shown lightly so that it won't make a GREAT IMPACT) to the users. How to do that? We want to hear from you; if you have any good ideas, please email LanchesLab@hotmail.com with the topic "Contri on #001" (Type it correctly or not it won't be recognized) to contribute; of course, you can also do it on GitHub. And as your contribution IS taken or at least known by us, you will fast receive an email with a code that will make you verified as a Contributor with your account on our platform once you type it into your settings.</u>*** We are during a brain-storm about it too.

#### So, that it is!
